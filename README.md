Who said romance is dead ? (wsrid-project)
=====

Just a quick project to learn the basics of Marionette (and have fun in the meantime).

It was also the occasion to learn how to use js to do some webscraping (I usually use Scrapy, a very efficient Python framework).

The idea is very simple : the application fetches a random comment from the most viewed
videos of the all time on redtube.come and displays it. You can display another random
comment by clicking a button. Simple as...fuck ? (how dare I).

The project is still a beta and as you can see in the commits I changed my strategy several times as I encountered difficulties.
