Who said romance is dead ? (wsrid-project)
=====

Just a quick project to learn the basics of Marionette (and have fun in the meantime).

It was also the occasion to learn how to use js to do some webscraping (I usually use Scrapy, a very efficient Python framework).

The idea is very simple : the application fetches an array of comments from the most viewed
videos of the week on redtube.come and displays them one by one. You can display another random
comment by clicking a button and once every element of the array has been viewed, the app
goes on to fetch some more from page 2 and so on.
